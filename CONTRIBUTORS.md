ILB wrote many of these functions for personal use, in a few different programming languages, over the years. They were put together in a single .py file in 2021 for [REYD](https://github.com/REYD-TTS), a Yiddish text-to-speech project, and then packaged as [a standalone Python library](https://pypi.org/project/yiddish/) in 2022. SL contributed the German romanization function designed for use with aeneas, an audio-text synchronizer. JL contributed functions to handle Soviet Yiddish.

Eliezer Niborski provided the original list of *loshn-koydesh* (Hebrew- and Aramaic-origin) words in Yiddish, which were subsequently expanded and imported into the current library as a submodule. See: https://github.com/ibleaman/loshn-koydesh-pronunciation
